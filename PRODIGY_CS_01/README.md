# Caesar Cipher Tool in Python

This is a simple Python program that performs encryption and decryption using the Caesar Cipher algorithm. It allows users to input a message and a shift value, then choose to either encrypt or decrypt the message.

## What is Caesar Cipher

Caesar Cipher is a classic encryption technique where each letter in the text is shifted by a certain number of positions in the alphabet. It is one of the simplest and most well-known ciphers.

Example:
If the shift is 3:
- A becomes D
- B becomes E
- Z becomes C

## Features

• Encrypt messages using Caesar Cipher  
• Decrypt encrypted messages  
• User-friendly command-line interface  
• Non-alphabet characters like spaces, numbers, and punctuation remain unchanged

## How to Use

1. Make sure Python 3 is installed on your system
2. Save the program as `caesar_cipher.py`
3. Run it using the following command:

```bash
python caesar_cipher.py
