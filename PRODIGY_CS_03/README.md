# Password Strength Checker in Python

This is a simple Python tool that checks the strength of a password based on common security standards. It gives the user feedback on whether the password is strong, moderate, or weak, and provides suggestions to improve it.

## How it works

The tool evaluates the password based on the following criteria:

• Minimum length of 8 characters  
• Presence of lowercase letters  
• Presence of uppercase letters  
• Inclusion of digits  
• Use of special characters (such as !, @, #, etc)

Each criterion adds to the password score and determines the final strength level.

## Features

• Rates password as Weak, Moderate, or Strong  
• Provides helpful suggestions for improvement  
• Easy to run on any system with Python installed  
• Great for practicing regex and logic building in Python

## How to Run

1. Make sure Python 3 is installed on your system  
2. Save the code in a file called `password_strength_checker.py`  
3. Run the script using:

```bash
python password_strength_checker.py
